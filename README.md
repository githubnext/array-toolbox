### Version Usage

<BlockComponent
  block={{"owner":"jaked","repo":"mermaid-block","id":"mermaid-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"repo":"array-toolbox","owner":"githubnext","path":"versionusage.mermaid","sha":"HEAD","file":"README.md"}}
height={433}
/>

<BlockComponent
  block={{"owner":"githubnext","repo":"blocks-examples","id":"excalidraw-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"repo":"array-toolbox","owner":"githubnext","path":"diagram.excalidraw","sha":"HEAD","file":"README.md"}}
/>


This is a library for working with arrays!

We'll be using this as the sample data for all the documentation:

<BlockComponent
  block={{"type":"file","id":"json-block","title":"Object explorer","description":"An interactive view of JSON objects","sandbox":false,"entry":"blocks/file-blocks/json.tsx","matches":["*.json","*.webmanifest","webmanifest","prettierrc","*.prettierrc","*.yaml","*.yml"],"example_path":"https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/main/package.json","owner":"githubnext","repo":"blocks-examples"}}
context={{"repo":"array-toolbox","owner":"githubnext","path":"sample_data.json","sha":"main","file":"README.md"}}
/>
Here's a playground for exploring the API:


<BlockComponent
  block={{"owner":"githubnext","repo":"blocks-examples","id":"sandbox-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"repo":"array-toolbox","owner":"githubnext","path":"examples/sample1.js","sha":"HEAD","file":"README.md"}}
/>
## `compact`

Removes all the falsy values from the array.
